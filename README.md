# IPL_score_prediction using deep learning 
With every run and choice having a chance to change the result in the modern age of cricket research, the use of deep learning for IPL score prediction is at the forefront of innovation. This article examines the innovative use of advanced algorithms to predict IPL scores in real-time matches with previously unknown accuracy.Exploring the analysis of historical data, player statistics, and real-time match conditions, discover how these predictive models are reshaping strategic insights and elevating the excitement of cricket analytics. Whether you’re a cricket aficionado or a data science enthusiast, uncover how this technology is revolutionizing the game’s predictive capabilities and strategic planning.
# Why use Deep Learning for IPL Score Prediction?
We humans can’t easily identify patterns from huge data, and thus here, machine learning and IPL score prediction using deep learning come into play. These advanced techniques learn from how players and teams have performed against each other in the past, training models to predict outcomes more accurately. While traditional machine learning algorithms provide moderate accuracy, IPL Score In live prediction benefits greatly from deep learning models that consider various attributes to deliver more precise results.

## Step-by-Step Guide to IPL Score Prediction using Deep Learning
Step 1: First, let’s import all the necessary libraries:

Step 2: Loading the dataset!
When dealing with cricket data, it contains data from the year 2008 to 2017. The dataset can be downloaded from here. The dataset contain features like venue, date, batting and bowling team, names of batsman and bowler, wickets and more.
We imported both the datasets using .read_csv() method into a dataframe using pandas and displayed the first 5 rows of each dataset.

Step 3: Data Pre-processing
3.1 Dropping unimportant features
We have created a new dataframe by dropping several columns from the original DataFrame.
The new DataFrame contains the remaining columns that we are going to train the predictive model.

3.2 Further Pre-Processing
We have split the data frame into independent variable (X) and dependent variables (y). Our dependent variables is the total score.

3.3 Label Encoding
We have applied label encoding to your categorical features in X.
We have created separate LabelEncoder objects for each categorical feature and encoded their values.
We have created mappings to convert the encoded labels back to their original values, which can be helpful for interpreting the results.

3.4 Train Test Split
We have split the data into training and testing sets. The training set contains 70 percent of the dataset and rest 30 percent is in test set.
X_train contains the training data for your input features.
X_test contains the testing data for your input features.
y_train contains the training data for your target variable.
y_test contains the testing data for your target variable.

3.5 Feature Scaling
We have performed Min-Max scaling on our input features to ensure all the features are on the same scale
Scaling is performed to ensure consistent scale to improve model performance.
Scaling has transformed both training and testing data using the scaling parameters.

Step 4: Define the Neural Network
We have defined a neural network using TensorFlow and Keras for regression.
After defining the model, we have compiled the model using the Huber Loss because of the robustness of the regression against outliers.

Step 5: Model Training
We have trained the neural network model using the scaled training data.
After the training, we have stored the training and validation loss values to our neural network during the training process.

Step 6: Model Evaluation
We have predicted using the trained neural network on the testing data.
The variable predictions contains the predicted total run scores for the test set based on the model’s learned patterns.

Step 7: Let’s create an Interactive Widget
We have created an interactive widget using ipywidgets to predict the score based on user input for venue, batting team, bowling team, striker, and bowler.
We have created dropdown widgets to select values for venue, batting team, bowling team, striker, and bowler.
Then, we have added a “Predicted Score” button widget. Whenever, the button will be clicked, the predict_score function will be called and then perform the following steps:
Decodes the user-selected values to their original categorical values.
Encodes and scales these values to match the format used in model training.
Uses the trained model to make a prediction based on the user’s input.
Displays the predicted score.
